# ml-dashboard-ecommerce
An interactive Streamlit application for exploring machine learning models on Brazilian e-commerce data — includes classification, regression, clustering, and market basket analysis.
# 📊 Brazilian E-commerce Machine Learning Application

This project is an interactive **Streamlit web application** that demonstrates the use of various **machine learning techniques** on a **synthetic Brazilian e-commerce dataset**. It helps users explore patterns, gain insights, and apply models like classification, regression, clustering, and association rule mining.

## 🚀 Features

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
  - Regression (Linear Regression)

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - KMeans Clustering
  - Market Basket Analysis (Apriori, Association Rules)

- **Data Visualizations**
  - Histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**

- **Synthetic Dataset Generator**
  - Simulates realistic Brazilian e-commerce data (e.g., state-wise transactions, product categories, ratings)
